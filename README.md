A project to build a roomba style vaccuum cleaner on the cheap. Using a tutorial from here https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/build-your-own-arduino-based-smart-vacuum-cleaning-robot-for-automatic-floor-cleaning.

The intention is of course to expand upon the initial code to control the vaccuum via a relay etc. But for now the barebones wandering code will do.
